# Orchino
## Introduction
[SORESPO](https://github.com/orchestron-orchestrator/sorespo) is our primary
example on how to implement your own orchestrator. If you have not yet read
through the SORESPO documentation and its [tutorials](https://github.com/orchestron-orchestrator/sorespo/docs/tutorials/README.md),
we strongly recommend you start there. When you are ready to design your own
Orchestron-based orchestrator, we recommend you fork SORESPO and modify it to
fit your needs.

But, we also very much understand that the SORESPO project with its many bells
and whissles can be a little overwhelming when you are just starting out with
developing for Orchestron. That's where Orchino comes in. Use this project as
a playground for your first baby steps with the platform.
